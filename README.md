# Fraud-Detection
A classification problem consisting of an imbalanced data set to predict if a transaction through a given credit card is fraudulent. Checked for features having null values. On visualizing the data points based on number of fraudulent or non-fraudulent transactions, it was clear that the data is highly imabalanced since the number of fraudulent transactions accounted for only 0.2% of the total number of transactions.Resampled the data using two methods, one being random undersampling and the other being SMOTE. Applied logistic regression, decision trees and random forests models on the resampled data.Checked accuracy on resampled testing data with accuracy metric recall_score(sensitivity) as the most important task is to identify fraudulent cases. It was observed that the recall score increases significantly as the application of classification models is done on imbalanced data, undersampled data and data synthesised using SMOTE.
